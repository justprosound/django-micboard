# Archive Overview

This folder retains historical documentation, delivery records, and completion summaries that are no longer part of the active docs site. Use [INDEX.md](INDEX.md) to navigate the archived material. Root-level markdown documents were relocated here on 2026-01-26 to keep the repository root focused on source code and the primary README.

Key areas:
- INDEX.md — master table of archived docs
- root/ — former project-root markdown files
- PHASE2_COMPLETION.md — Phase 2 delivery summary

These files are intentionally excluded from the main navigation but remain available for reference.
